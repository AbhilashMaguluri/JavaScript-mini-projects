# 🔢 Armstrong Number Checker  

A simple and interactive **Armstrong Number Checker** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Enter a number and instantly check whether it is an **Armstrong number**.  

An **Armstrong number** is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  

Examples:  
- 153 → \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\) ✅  
- 9474 → \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9474\) ✅  
- 151 → \(1^3 + 5^3 + 1^3 = 127\) ❌
